      <h1>Welcome to Alex's Webpage!</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoy working out in the <strong>gym</strong>. It provides me with
        <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>health benefits</strong>. I am
        very interested in <strong>physical fitness</strong> and
        <strong>eating healthy</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a

        that I constantly refer to when it comes to what weight I should be
        lifting according to the average athlete.

        Below is an example of my favorite exercise, the
        <strong>dumbbell press</strong>. This shows the muscle groups it is
        targeting, along with the motion involved. If you click the image, you
        will be taken to a different website that further details this exercise.
      </p>

      <h2>Three things to focus on when doing dumbbell press:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Lay <strong>flat</strong> on bench, use <strong>feet as base</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retract</strong> shoulders, make sure lower back is not on
          bench.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contract</strong> and <strong>stretch</strong> chest when
          lowering and raising weight.
        </li>
      </ul>
